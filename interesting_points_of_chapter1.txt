What I found most interesting in Chapter 1 is how distributed systems are constrained by real-world physical limitations. For example, network communication always has latency, so information cannot be shared instantly across all machines. In addition, each node in a distributed system can fail independently, which makes failures unavoidable. Because of these constraints, distributed systems cannot behave like a single, reliable machine. Designers must carefully choose strategies such as data partitioning and replication to handle these issues. These choices are not just technical preferences, but necessary trade-offs to balance scalability, availability, and performance.
